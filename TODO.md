## Compiler-specific Options Files

It should be possible to have compiler-specific option files and
option file conditionals in options files so things like warning flags
can be tailored to the compiler.

## Linux-based OS Library Naming

Linux distributions like to use all manner of directories to hold
libraries and compiler-version dependent libraries so the current
hard-coded paths are not sufficient and probably incorrect.
